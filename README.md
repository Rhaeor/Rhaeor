Hi, I’m Rhaeor, a content creator and Lead Technical Artist for SE.
I’m interested in learning new things, metal music, and dad jokes.
I’m currently learning, Javascript and C#, and two other non-programming languages.
I’m looking to collaborate on Game Dev and Bot Development.
If interested, reach out to me via my e-mail.
